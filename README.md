## 📜 About



SkySkipped simplifies your life in Hypixel SkyBlock by automating things you would otherwise do manually — clicking, walking, selling, opening menus, selecting dungeon classes, farming crops, and more.

It doesn’t pretend to be a “legal” quality-of-life mod — it’s a tool for players who know what they’re doing and accept the risks of automation.
